# Python Game
It is a python game thing that I started making, not sure where I plan to go with it yet

Don't expect much, this is my second python program

This program requires Python 3 and Pygame

Start the program by running the following command: `python game.py`

Controls: WASD or Arrow keys to move, Q and E or number keys to cycle through inventory slots, F to use items, and R to toggle worlds.

Development version is available in dev branch
